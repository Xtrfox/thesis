\chapter{Methodology}

The methodology of this thesis will be guided by the design philosophy of user-centered design, or more specifically, as gamification will be the focus, player-centered design. User-centered design puts the user at the forefront; as the hoped-for outcome is increased user engagement with ShineOS, the priority should be understanding the needs of the user before even attempting to add to or modify the features of the app. Player-centered design builds on the efficiency and satisfaction aimed for by user-centered design through increased user involvement: beyond satisfaction, the application also triggers in the user feelings of happiness and fun.

The methodology will also be heavily based on the user experience design process and on design thinking, which is a 5-step process consisting of: (1) empathize; (2) define; (3) ideate; (4) prototype; and (5) test. This is by no means a closed process, in the sense that you go through the steps sequentially and then you are done; instead, it is more like an iterative process, where you loop through the steps as you incorporate new data.

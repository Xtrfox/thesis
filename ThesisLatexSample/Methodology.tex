\chapter{Methodology}

The primary focus of this research is the infodemiological surveillance of three (3) of the top communicable diseases - Measles, Influenza, Typhoid Fever -  in the Philippines, as reported by the Philippines' Department of Health (DOH) \cite{dohrecord2015}. The research is divided into two parts, which are 1) collection of health-related tweets and their visualization in a map, and 2) the modeling and prediction of possible areas of outbreaks based on Twitter posts.

This section breaks down the phases further into five (5) subsections, \textit{Health Data Collection}, \textit{Infodemiological Modeling and Classification}, \textit{Twitter Data Visualization}, \textit{Epidemiological Correlation and Modeling}, and \textit{STEM Scenario Visualization}. The overview of the methodology can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:GeneralMethodology}.

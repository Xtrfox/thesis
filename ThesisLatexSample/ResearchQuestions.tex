\section{Research Questions}

This research aims to answer the question ``Can social media posts from Twitter be one of the determinants of disease outbreaks within the Philippines?''

Other subquestions are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item What are related keywords and phrases frequently mentioned by Twitter users regarding the three diseases, especially when they are prevalent across an area?
\item What attributes of social media posts are accessible and significant to be able to produce a population surveillance report?
\item How do we interface tweets with syndromic surveillance data from existing systems of the Department of Health as well as from electronic medical records (EMR)?
\item How do we develop a validated spatio-temporal epidemiological model that shows and forecasts possible outbreak areas based on Twitter posts?
\end{itemize}
